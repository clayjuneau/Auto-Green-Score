### Directions for walking through the notebook

Make sure the raw data (data.csv and all_alpha_17.xlsx) is in the same folder as the notebook.

The data.csv file came from https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset (credit to CooperUnion)

The all_alpha_17.xlsx came from https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml (credit to the EPA and US Department of Energy)

These are the required libraries needed to run the notebook:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* ipywidgets
* matplotlib
* yellowbrick


Note: The interactive interface at the bottom of the notebook does not work within the GitHub Jupyter Notebook viewer.
