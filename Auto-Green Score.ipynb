    "The climate is something that people are becoming more and more conscious about. We took that information along with knowing that buying a car is no small task, and from these these we decided to build a recommendation system for consumers who are buying cars. The people we are going to appeal to are people who care about the environment and care about how much they are spending and the quality of the car."

    "The first part of our project was deciding what data we wanted to use to make our claim. We knew that we wanted to find csv data that would be easy to clean and use. We also wanted to find data on cars that had the features, MSRP, and environmental effect of cars. We were able to find data that was on Kaggle that had car features along with MSRP and the most recent year for the data from Kaggle was 2017. We had to select 2017 for the year from the data we got from Kaggle. From that we were able to find environmental effects of cars from Greenhouse gas score that was available on Fuel Economy gov. We decided that from both of these data sets that we would have sufficient information to conduct our analysis and create a recommendation system. "

    "## Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we needed to clean and combine the data so we would have consistent data that would be able to be easily analyzed. There were many columns within both data sets that meant the same thing but were written differently so we had to clean and combine data to match it up. For example the Kaggle data had \"rear wheel drive\",\"all wheel drive\", \"front wheel drive\", and \"four wheel drive\" while the Fuel Economy data had \"2WD\" and \"4WD\". From these options we combined rear wheel and front wheel drive to 2WD and we combined all wheel and four wheel drive to 4WD.  We decided to convert the data to the Fuel Economy data set features because the were more generic. We also had to combine the fuel as well and it was a similar process as the wheel drive process except for the Hybrid and the Gasoline/Electricity feature. We had to see what cars in the Kaggle data had Hybrid in the Market Category and from there we converted that to Gasoline/Electricity."

We had to create slots for these and insert in the information into the Fuel Economy data from Kaggle data. There were duplicates in the Kaggle data for certain cars and what we decided to do is that with Models that had the same name and the same \"Drive\" we took the lowest MSRP and put that in out combined data and considered that the \"Base Model\" of the car. We did not include cars that cost over $100,000 because we wanted the recommednation system to be for common people. Then we took out data that had slashes because it would have been hard to compare the MPG data that had two different numbers and we did not have an easy way to get the correct MPG."

    "For our first analysis we decided to plot Greenhouse Gas Score versus MSRP to show the correlation between cars that are environmentally friendly and the cost of cars. From this we were able to create a trendline that as the Greenhouse Gas Score (10 being the best and 0 being the worst for the environment) goes up the MSRP goes down and that is the trendline consumers should buy the cars on. In our analysis we made the assumption that the quality of the car is related to the MSRP, so the higher the car cost the better the car would be. We said that from the trendline that the area below the curve would be cars that are not very environmentally friendly for the price point and the area above the trendline are cars that cost too much for their Greenhouse gas score."

    "We then wanted to make sure that there was relation between the features of the car and the Greenhouse Gas Score. We took the data and ran different regression models on it, we used Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and KNeighborClassifier. We chose these models because we wanted to have diverse regressions and numbers to compare. From the Random Forest Regression with 10 trees we were able to see that it had a 99% success rate. During our presentation we were asked if that number seemed too high because Random Forest is known for overfitting data. So we ran the regression again with only 1 tree and were able to still get 99%."

    "## Determing most important features: Greenhouse Gas Score and MSRP\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we wanted to figure out what which features carried the most weight when it came to Green HouseHas score and MSRP. We took all the features from both and created a model using Random Forest Regression, and from there was able to get the importance of each feature in regards to Greenhouse Gas Score and MSRP. For Greenhouse Gas Score we could see that the things that affects the Greenhouse Gas Score the most were, City MPG, Comb MPG and Comb CO2(This is the CO2 emissions the car has). Comb MPG and COMB CO2 out of those three were the most influential and Comb MPG was the most influential which made sense. As the car can drive more miles per gallon, it would be using less gas therefore releasing less emissions therefore being better for the environment.\n",
    "The feature that was the most influential for MSRP was Horsepower. This made sense because as cars get more and more powerful the more expensive the car is going to get. With cars being more powerful they are going to put more luxury features in a car that would also make the MSRP go up."

    "## Most important feature analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to analyze the importance of the features for the MSRP and Greenhouse Gas Score and specifically, we wanted to look at how Horsepower related to MSRP and we saw that as the price of the MSRP went up the values of the actual data strayed more away from the trendline value that we got from linear regression. We were able to see this from the graph that we had visualized. From the data from there, we created another visual that plotted the residual data to see where horsepower would not be a good estimate.  We found that at large MSRP the variance increased, so horsepower was not a good feature at the extreme. "

    "We decided to use linear regression to predict the MSRP and Greenhouse gas Score of a given car. We wanted to do this based on properties of the car and not attributes like MPG that could be directly correlated with one of the output variables (in this case Greenhouse Gas score). First, we kept only the direct properties of the car: its maker, the number of displays, the number of cycles, its fuel type, its vehicle class, its horesepower, and its number of doors. Then, we fit three linear regressions with the properties as input. The first predicted Greenhouse Gas Score, the second predicts MSRP, and the third predicts the ratio score, which is defined as $\\frac{10000*GreenhouseGasScore}{MSRP}$. Our goal is to use these features to help the user make the best decision possible when purchasing a car."

    "2. The car buyer will input their answers to their desired feature.\n",

CO2 emissions typically constitute 99% of the tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. Vehicles that score a 10 on the GHG score are the cleanest.\n",
